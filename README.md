Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 â†’ iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.
